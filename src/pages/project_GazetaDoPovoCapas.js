                <h1>Home Page Customization Research</h1>
                <p>Try a new concept of customizable homepage, where users could get news according to the profile they get in a quiz. The idea was to create a user centered newspaper with news according to the user profile, like main business players such as Netflix or Spotify.</p>

                <h2>Project scope:</h2>

                <p>14 newspaper readers were selected according to their interaction and visits to Gazeta do Povo newspaper website. 12 interviews were done in a controlled environment, where 3 models of customizable homepages were presented to the user so they can navigate and test the concept. Inputs about the navigation and viability of the project were collected.</p>

                <p>The results showed that newspaper users donâ€™t like customizable homepages, because they think that they are missing the latest news due to the preference filters. </p>

                <p>The homepage project was aborted after the results and a new project of news recommendation started.</p>
                
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>I acted as a UX Designer, helping to plan the research, apply user interviews and design user prototypes for testing.</p>
